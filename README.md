# Predicting Revenue Generation with Customers' Web Browsing Data
* Created a prediction model designed to classify whether or not a customer will generate revenue for the company based on their browsing tendencies on the company website
* The data set included 15+ variables, including which sections of the website they visited, how long they visited those sections for, if they were a returning visitor and more
* Within Python, several Supervised Learning machine learning algorithms were utilized including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
* Unsupervised Learning method, Clustering, was also employed in order to gain further insight from the customer data
* Performance analysis determined that the Gradient Boosting model was the most effective method to use, with 90 percent accuracy
